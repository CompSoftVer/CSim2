\<comment>\<open>
  MLUtils is a collection of 'basic' ML utilities (kind of like @{file
  "~~/src/Pure/library.ML"}, but maintained by Trustworthy Systems). If you
  find yourself implementing:
      - A simple data-structure-shuffling task,
      - Something that shows up in the standard library of other functional
        languages, or
      - Something that's "missing" from the general pattern of an Isabelle ML
        library,
  consider adding it here.
