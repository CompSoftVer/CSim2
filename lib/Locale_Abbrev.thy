(*
  "Normal" abbreviations in locales provide input syntax only, i.e. they are not contracted on
  pretty printing. Presumably this is because a) this would not work with fixed variables on locale
  export and b) one cannot make a global decision whether everything is to be abbreviated only
  inside the locale or inside and outside, and so the safe option is to provide input only.

  This theory provides two commands:
    - revert_abbrev (print-mode) name (:: lthy \<Rightarrow> lthy)
        causes an already defined abbreviation \<open>name\<close> to always be contracted on pretty printing
        for the specified optional print mode. This only works when the abbreviation does not
        mention any fixed variables of the locale.

    - locale_abbrev spec (:: lthy \<Rightarrow> lthy)
        is an alias for the standard abbreviation command, followed by revert_abbrev.
        This is the command to use for abbreviations that should be contracted inside locales.
        Contrary to standard abbreviations, this command cannot mention fixed variables of the
        locale.
