Contributions to the seL4 kernel verification repository are welcome!


## CLA

Please note that GD and NICTA require a contributor license agreement (CLA)
to be signed for all external contributions. Please see
https://seL4.systems/Community/Contributing for details (it is a fairly short
and standard CLA).

For the `seL4/l4v` repository, we can review pull requests directly on github
if we have a signed CLA on file, no need to email a patch.

If you have only small trivial changes such as style, typos, comments, or
white space and don't want to sign a CLA for that, please file an issue in
the github issue tracker, we'll usually be happy to do the change for you and
attribute your idea by linking to the github issue in the change set comment.


## Build

If you're modifying existing proofs, texts, or tools, please make sure the
repository still builds before you send the pull requests by running the overall regression test in the repository root:

    ./run_tests


## Contact

If you have larger changes or additions, it might be a good idea to get in
contact with us as <devel@sel4.systems>, so we can help you get started.
