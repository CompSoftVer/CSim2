'''
Monitors the total CPU usage of a process and its children. Usage is similar
to the UNIX `time` utility.

NB: In order to get up-to-date information, we don't use interfaces such
    as os.times, which only includes terminated and waited-for children.
    Instead, we poll the process tree regularly. This means that when a
    child process dies, its CPU time since the last poll is lost and not
    included in the total time.

    Hence the total reported time will be an underestimate of the true
    CPU usage, especially for short-lived child processes.
