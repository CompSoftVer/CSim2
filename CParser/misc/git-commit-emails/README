This script takes a git repository, fetches any remote patches on the
repository, and then shoots out an email describing any new commits.

This should either be setup in cron to poll a remote repository, or---better
still---be executed by another script when a push event occurs.

One possible way or running it is as follows:

    ./commit-email.py \
        --repo project_name \
        --to mailing.list@example.com \
        --from mailing.list@example.com \
        ./path/to/repo
