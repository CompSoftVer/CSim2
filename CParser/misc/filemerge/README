============================
Graphical Diff for Mercurial
============================

This code lets you do a graphical diff in mercurial of Isabelle files
using FileMerge, a OS X merge program.

There are two parts:
1. Setting up mercurial to use FileMerge
2. Running a preprocessor script over the Isabelle files to produce Unicode.

Usage
======

hg opendiff

=====================================
Setting up mercurial to use FileMerge
=====================================

As documented at
http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/TipsAndTricks#Using_FileMerge.app.2BAC8-opendiff_as_the_diff_program_.28OS_X.29

1. Add the below to your .hgrc file

[extensions]
hgext.extdiff =

[extdiff]
cmd.opendiff =  fmdiff

2. Add fmdiff to a folder somewhere in your path.

=======================================
Setting up a predecessor for  FileMerge
=======================================

FileMerge doesn't understand x-symbols, but can run a preprocessor over
files first before it does a diff. (It appears as though you can't use
FileMerge to merge files when you do this.)

Thus, symbols.py does a find/replace on various x-symbols and replaces
them with their Unicode equivalents.

In FileMerge, go to FileMerge->Preferencesâ€¦->Filters
Below the current filters, double-click and add:
thy	~/xsymbol.py $(FILE)	Filtered	No

Change the location to where the xsymbol script is located.
