Isabelle Benchmarking Framework
===============================

This directory contains a framework and some sample tests for benchmarking the
performance of Isabelle at the ML level.

The benchmarks can be run by using the included script:

    ./benchmark.py BenchBasics.thy

If errors are detected, details can be discovered by passing in the verbose
"-v" flag:

    ./benchmark.py -v BenchBasics.thy

The python module "pexpect" is required, and is available in all leading
distribution packaging systems.

Parameters at the top of "benchmark.ML" allow you to control how accurate
the benchmarks are (number of repetitions, length of each benchmark) if
accurate numbers are required.
